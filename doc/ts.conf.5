.TH "TS.CONF" "5" "" "" "tslib"
.SH "NAME"
ts.conf \- Configuration file for tslib, controlling touch screens for embedded devices\&.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The idea of tslib is to have a core library that provides standardised services, and a set of plugins to manage the conversion and filtering as needed\&.
.PP
The plugins for a particular touchscreen are loaded automatically by the library under the control of a static configuration file,
/etc/ts\&.conf\&.
/etc/ts\&.conf
gives the library basic configuration information\&. Each line specifies one module, and the parameters for that module\&. The modules are loaded in order, with the first one processing the touchscreen data first\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
  module_raw input
  module variance delta=30
  module dejitter delta=100
  module linear

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Latest versions of the Xorg tslib input driver use
\fBhal\fR
to configure the touchscreen within Xorg\&. Environment variables are only needed for the tslib commands\&.
.PP
\fBTSLIB_TSDEVICE\fR

\fBTSLIB_TSDEVICE\fR
environment variable to the touchscreen device to use\&.

.RE
.SH "MODULE PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBvariance\fR
.RS 4
Tries to do it\*(Aqs best in order to filter out random noise coming from touchscreen ADC\*(Aqs\&. This is achieved by limiting the sample movement speed to some value (e\&.g\&. the pen is not supposed to move quicker than some threshold)\&.
.sp
This is a \*(Aqgreedy\*(Aq filter, e\&.g\&. it gives less samples on output than receives on input\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBdelta\fR
.sp
Set the squared distance in touchscreen units between previous and current pen position (e\&.g\&. (X2\-X1)^2 + (Y2\-Y1)^2)\&. This defines the criteria for determining whenever two samples are \*(Aqnear\*(Aq or \*(Aqfar\*(Aq to each other\&.
.sp
If the distance between previous and current sample is \*(Aqfar\*(Aq, the sample is marked as \*(Aqpotential noise\*(Aq\&. This doesn\*(Aqt mean yet that it will be discarded; if the next reading will be close to it, this will be considered just a regular \*(Aqquick motion\*(Aq event, and it will sneak to the next layer\&. Also, if the sample after the \*(Aqpotential noise\*(Aq is \*(Aqfar\*(Aq from both previously discussed samples, this is also considered a \*(Aqquick motion\*(Aq event and the sample sneaks into the output stream\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBdejitter\fR
.RS 4
Removes jitter on the X and Y co\-ordinates\&. This is achieved by applying a weighted smoothing filter\&. The latest samples have most weight; earlier samples have less weight\&. This allows to achieve 1:1 input\->output rate\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBdelta\fR
.sp
Squared distance between two samples ((X2\-X1)^2 + (Y2\-Y1)^2) that defines the \*(Aqquick motion\*(Aq threshold\&. If the pen moves quick, it is not feasible to smooth pen motion, besides quick motion is not precise anyway; so if quick motion is detected the module just discards the backlog and simply copies input to output\&.
