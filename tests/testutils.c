	 * are one-based instead of zero-based.  If this were the case
	 * and index was odd, we would need sample number ((index+1)/2)
	 * of a sorted array; if index was even, we would need the
	 * average of sample number (index/2) and sample number
	 * ((index/2)+1).  To turn this into something useful for the
	 * real world, we just need to subtract one off of the sample
	 * numbers.  So for when index is odd, we need sample number
	 * (((index+1)/2)-1).  Due to integer division truncation, we
	 * can simplify this to just (index/2).  When index is even, we
	 * need the average of sample number ((index/2)-1) and sample
	 * number (index/2).  Calculate (index/2) now and we'll handle
	 * the even odd stuff after we sort.
